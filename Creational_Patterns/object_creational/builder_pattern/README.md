# Object Creational: Builder

* Intent - Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

* Uses
  * When the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled
  * When the construction process must allow different representations for he object that's constructed

* Run the following ruby code to see the example pattern
* ruby maze_game.rb
