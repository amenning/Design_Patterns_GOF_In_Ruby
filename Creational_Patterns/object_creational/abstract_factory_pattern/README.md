# Object Creational: Abstract Factory

# Intent - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

# Also known as Kit

# Uses
## When a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented
## When a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products
## When a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint
## Whne you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations

# Run the following ruby code to see the example abstract factories
# ruby maze_game.rb
